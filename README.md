# Freelance Proposals templates collection application

Space for freelancers to find the best template available and write the best Proposals to clients.

Example proposal:

  "Hi Customer_name,

  It was pleasure getting to meet with you and review your project requirements. I believe it is a great fit for the types of applications that I build out. Please feel free to check out some of my past projects.

  To successfully build out the application I will be utilizing Ruby on Rails, EmberJS, and PostgreSQL, and a number of other tools to ensure that the project follows industry wide best practices.

  Ensuring that you are fully informed is one of my top priorities, so in addition to incorporating everything that we discussed, I will also be creating a project management dashboard and sending you a project update message daily so that you can have a transparent view of the development as it takes place.

  To accomplish the project and meet the requirements that we discussed, I am estimating that it will take 80 hours in development time to complete. The project should take 9 weeks to complete and with my hourly rate of 45/hr, the estimated total will be around $4000.

  The next step from here is to set up a meeting to finalize the project and sign contracts.

  I am excited to working with you and build out this project.
